## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Data not loading**
   - Check if your backend server is running
   - Verify the API_BASE_URL in AdminDashboard.jsx
   - Check browser console for error messages

2. **Update operations failing**
   - Ensure your backend routes are properly configured
   - Check that the user has proper permissions
   - Verify the data format being sent matches backend expectations

3. **CORS issues**
   - Make sure your backend has CORS properly configured
   - Check that the frontend and backend ports are correctly set

### Error Handling
The dashboard includes comprehensive error handling:
- Loading states while fetching data
- Error messages for failed operations
- Retry functionality for failed requests
- User-friendly notifications for all operations

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify `Dashboard.css` to change the appearance
- Update color schemes and layouts as needed
- Add custom animations and transitions

### Functionality
- Add new tabs for additional data types
- Implement delete functionality for events/users
- Add bulk operations for multiple items
- Implement real-time updates using WebSocket

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Ensure proper authentication is implemented
2. **Authorization**: Verify user roles and permissions
3. **Data Validation**: Validate all input data on both frontend and backend
4. **API Security**: Use HTTPS and implement proper API security measures

## Performance Optimization

1. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large datasets
2. **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load data on demand
4. **Debouncing**: Implement search debouncing for better performance
